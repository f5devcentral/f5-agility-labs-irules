Additional Lab 5 - Geolocation
------------------------------

Scenario
~~~~~~~~~

All of your critical applications are protected by F5 Advanced Web Application Firewall (AWAF), and leverage F5's Layer 7 DoS feature to mitigate bot activity and protect application resources from layer 7 volumetric attacks.  To simplify the initial deployment, the application security team elected to disable F5's Proactive Bot Defense (PBD) feature.  

Recently, the business analysis team has noticed a significant increase in the application traffic from Russia and believe much of this traffic to be a bot related activity. Since this traffic is having a negative impact on the business's ability to analyze data and increasing load on the server infrastructure, the business is requesting you to take a more aggressive action on traffic sourced from Russia.  The security team would like to leverage PBD for this traffic to block the simple automated bot activity.

Restraints
~~~~~~~~~~~
The following restraints complicate this request from the business:

- AWAF DoS Profile allows you to whitelist/blacklist geolocations globally across the DoS profile and allows for specific thresholds to be defined for geolocations for Transaction Per Second (TPS) and Stress-based protections.  However, it does not allow for per geolocation enabling/disabling of PBD.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To meet the businessâ€™s objectives, while still maintaining a strong security policy, an iRule solution must meet the following requirements:

- Proactive Bot Defense should be enabled for all traffic from Russia, but disabled for traffic initiated from everywhere else.
- Bot Signature protection should remain enforced for all traffic.
- Selectively enabling PBD should **not** affect any of the existing L7DoS protections currently enforced.

Baseline Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prior to defining a solution, validate the issue by testing the application to validate AWAF's current behavior:

- RDP to the lab jump station 
- Open Terminal application
- From Terminal run the following command against the test web application
 
  .. code-block:: console
    
     f5student@xjumpbox~$ curl -k http://hackazon.f5demo.com/ -H "X-forwarded-for: 5.16.0.1" | grep -i ?type=


- The result of the test should look similar to below, with grep returning no match, and the object response size ~64k


  .. image:: /_static/class2/pbd_baseline_test1.png
      :width: 1000


- PBD is not active and not responding to the HTTP request with javascript challenge
- From Terminal, run the same command, but change the value of the ``X-forwarded-for`` header to be 2.2.2.2
- Traffic sourced from Russia should match the behavior of all other geolocations, and no proactive bot defense challenges are being issued.


The iRule
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: tcl 

   when CLIENT_ACCEPTED {
      set geopbd_debug_verb 1
      set geopdb_debug 1
   }

   when HTTP_REQUEST {
      if { [HTTP::header exists "X-Forwarded-For"] } {
          set XFF [getfield [lindex [HTTP::header values X-Forwarded-For] 0] "," 1]
      }
      else {
         set XFF [IP::client_addr]
     }

      if {$geopbd_debug_verb} {
          log local0. "Coninent: [whereis $XFF continent]"
          log local0. "Country: [whereis $XFF country]"
          log local0. "State: [whereis $XFF state] "
          log local0. "ISP: [whereis $XFF isp] "
          log local0. "Org: [whereis $XFF org] "
      }
    
      if {!([whereis $XFF country] equals "RU")} {
          if {$geopdb_debug} {
             log local0. "De-activating PBD: Not Russia source"
           }
          BOTDEFENSE::disable
      }

   }

   when BOTDEFENSE_ACTION {
   #catch the inbound status
      if {$geopdb_debug} {
         log local0. " Geolocation Country: [whereis $XFF country] "
         log local0. " Bot Defense Status: [BOTDEFENSE::reason] "
         log local0. " Bot Defense Action: [BOTDEFENSE::action] "
      }
   }


Analysis
~~~~~~~~~
Event/Command details:

-  The iRules ``whereis`` command can take several options, including:

   - ``[whereis [IP::client_addr] continent]``: returns the three-letter
     continent

   - ``[whereis [IP::client_addr] country]``: returns the two-letter
     country code

   - ``[whereis [IP::client_addr] <state|abbrev>]``: returns the state as
     word or as two-letter abbreviation

   - ``[whereis [IP::client_addr] isp]``: returns the carrier

   - ``[whereis [IP::client_addr] org]``: returns the registered
     organization

- ``BOTDEFENSE`` command enables or disables bot defense processing
- ``BOTDEFENSE_ACTION`` event is triggered after the HTTP request has been processed, and just prior to taking action on transaction.  The event is triggered whenever PBD is enabled, if a DoS L7 attack is configured to trigger PBD, or when a Bot Signature was detected on the request.
- ``BOTDEFENSE::reason`` returns the reason the for the bot defense action
- ``BOTDEFENSE::action`` returns the action to be taken by bot defense feature

Rule Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This rule does the following:

- Inspects the inbound X-Forwarded-For header or Client IP address, and performs a geolocation lookup on the value.  If either the XFF or the Client IP do **not** match the Russia country code, "RU", then botdefense is disabled. Otherwise Bot Defense is enabled.
- Logs the geolocation information on to a local logger
- Logs the botdefense reason and action to a local logger

.. NOTE::

   This rule uses the DoS Profile, iRules_Sec, which has been created for you as part of the lab setup 

Testing
~~~~~~~~~
From BIG-IP UI:

- Navigate to Security -> DoS Protection -> DoS Profiles -> iRules_Sec -> Application Security Tab
- Click the Proactive Bot Defense button, and set the Operation Mode to Always
- Click Update
 
- Navigate to Local Traffic -> Virtual Servers -> Virtual Server List -> ``vs_hackazon_http``
- Click the Resources tab, then the Manage button to the right of the iRules section header
- Move the iRule ``sec_irules_geobased_pbdswitcher`` from the Available box to the Enabled box
- Click Finished

- Open Terminal application, and create a new tab, then run following command

 .. code-block:: console 
    
    f5student@xjumpbox~$ ssh root@10.1.1.245

- From BIG-IP console run the following command:
 
 .. code-block:: console 
    
    f5student@xjumpbox~$ tail -f /var/log/ltm 

- On original Terminal Application tab, run the following command:
 
 .. code-block:: console
    
    f5student@xjumpbox~$ curl -k http://hackazon.f5demo.com/ -H "X-forwarded-for: 5.16.0.1" | grep -i ?type=

- Response should look similar to below image.  You should see that PBD has injected a javascript challenge, and the response body should be ~5.8K

   .. image:: /_static/class2/pbd_test1.png
      :width: 1000

- From Terminal, run the same command but change the value of the ``X-forwarded-for`` header to be 2.2.2.2

- This request is not issued from a Russian source, so PBD does not issue a challenge.  The response is missing the challenge, and the response body is ~64K. 

- From BIG-IP UI, view the Bot Defense logs:

- Security -> Event Logs -> Bot Defense -> Requests

- In this log, look at requests from ``5.16.0.1`` and ``2.2.2.2``
- You will see both requests are properly classified as bots, but only requests from ``5.16.0.1`` are challenged

- On Xubuntu Jumpbox, open another Firefox tab

- browse to http://hackazon.f5demo.com/

- Return to BIG-IP Bot Defense log

- Notice browser issued requests will source from 10.1.10.51, and will show the following:

  - Request Status = Legal
  - Action = allow
  - Reason =  Bot Defense Inactive


.. NOTE::

   Bot Defense is inactive, because the request wasnt sourced from "Russia", and we have disabled PBD.

- Return to Firefox, and right click the Firefox Modify Header Add-on on the right-side of the screen

- Select Open options page

- Scroll all the way to buttom of options screen and click the disable box in the rule for http://hackazon.f5demo.com 

- verify the box turns blue.  This enables insertion of X-Forwarded-For header in browser request

- Again, browse to http://hackazon.f5demo.com

- Return to BIG-IP Bot Defense log

- Notice browser issued requests will source from 5.16.0.1, and will show the following:

  - Geolocation = RU
  - Request Status = Legal
  - Action = browser_challenged (on request for first object), and allow on subsequent requests
  - Reason = No Valid Cookie: Challenge is possible (on request for first object), and Valid Cookie: No need to review on subsequent requests


Review
~~~~~~~
Geolocation, while not foolproof, is often an important piece of context about a user or device. 
Proactive Bot Defense is a very powerful feature for mitigating bot and automated activity but 
sometimes, it is challenging to implement in a single broad stroke. 

In the above lab, we have used iRules to take advantage of the additional context gained 
through the iRule geolocation commands to leverage a very powerful security feature in a 
targeted manner.  This is precisely the kind of challenge iRules are best suited for, 
stitching together pieces of information and features to deliver a solution customized 
to solve a business challenge.


Bonus Activity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One of our existing requirements was to not change any of our existing L7DoS protections.
In the lab, we demonstrated that changes via iRule didnt affect Bot Signatures. As a bonus, 
you can also verify the iRule enforced PBD for the Russian sources also doesn't impair the 
pre-existing L7DoS protections configured in the DoS profile.

- Return to Firefox and right-click the Firefox Modify Header Add-on on the right-side of the screen

- Click the Disable button. This time turning it gray

- From the browser tab, open http://hackazon.f5demo.com
  
- Click the refresh icon rapidly for ~30 seconds

- You will see the requests beginning to fail. This is the L7DoS protection kicking in and rate limiting requests from non-Russian sources

- Return to BIG-IP UI

- Navigate to Security -> Event Logs -> DoS -> Application Events

- You should see a L7DoS attack has been triggered and detected by Source IP TPS

- Repeat same steps, but after re-enabling the X-Forwarded-For header in the browser add-on

- You should be able to trigger an attack, but this time using a Russian source.

With the above steps, you have demonstrated that you can inject PBD challenges for sources 
from a given geolocation while maintaining all pre-existing protections. We have just used 
more context to enable more security using an iRule!
