Additional Lab 6 - IP Reputation
--------------------------------

IP Reputation is a subscription-based service that provides an F5 BIG-IP
with an active and upto date set of data for a known "bad actors". In 
this case we’re going to look at the source address (or in our test case 
an X-Forwarded-For HTTP header) to determine if this is a known bad guy. 
If you don’t already have an IP Reputation subscription, contact your local 
F5 representative for a time-limited evaluation license.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  BIG-IP LTM, web server, and a client (command line cURL)

The iRule
~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: tcl

   when HTTP_REQUEST {
       # Use [HTTP::header values "X-Forwarded-For"] for testing
       #set iprep_categories [IP::reputation [IP::client_addr]]
       set iprep_categories [IP::reputation [HTTP::header values "X-Forwarded-For"]]
       set is_reject 0
       if { $iprep_categories contains "Windows Exploits" } {
           set is_reject 1
       }
       if { $iprep_categories contains "Web Attacks" } { 
           set is_reject 1
       }
       if { $iprep_categories contains "Scanners" } { 
           set is_reject 1
       }
       if { $iprep_categories contains "Proxy" } { 
           set is_reject 1
       }
       if { $is_reject } {
           log local0. "Attempted access from malicious IP address [HTTP::header values "X-Forwarded-For"]($iprep_categories) - rejected" 
           HTTP::respond 200 content "<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Rejected Request</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>The request was rejected   . <BR>Attempted access from malicious IP address</BODY></HTML>"
       }
   }


Analysis
~~~~~~~~

-  With an active subscription to the IP Reputation service, iRules have
   access to a wealth of near real-time information about bad actors,
   including exploit sites, scanners, proxies, and others.

-  With this example iRule, a detected bad site will immediately
   generate an HTML failure page and reject access to the web
   application.

Testing
~~~~~~~

- Apply this iRule to an HTTP virtual server (VIP).

- From a command line, issue a cURL command and include an ``X-Forwarded-For`` header:

  ``curl http://www.f5test.local -H "X-Forwarded-For: 186.64.120.104"``

- Here are a few bad IP addresses to test:

  - 103.4.52.150
  - 101.200.81.187
  - 103.19.89.118
  - 103.230.84.239

- Here are a few bots to test:

  - 187.174.252.247
  - 188.120.224.250
  - 188.219.154.228
  - 188.241.140.212

.. NOTE:: Using ``iprep_lookup <IP_addr>`` on the BIG-IP command line
   will provide ip reputation information.
